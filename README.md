# ML-Pipelines
This project is divided into two parts: 

(1) Use tree-based methods and neural networks in order to analyze the UCI Adult Income Dataset, which predicts whether annual income of an individual exceeds $50K/yr based on census data. 

(2) Build an unsupervised pipeline that is able to classify songs in a Kaggle Spotify dataset into genres based on a combination of features using dimensionality reduction and clustering methods.
